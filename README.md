# What's a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.
# The Catalog of Design Patterns
# 1- Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    * Factory Method 
    * Abstract Factory
    * Builder 
    * Prototype
    * Singleton
# 2- Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    * Adapter 
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy 
# 3- Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    * Chain of Responsibilty
    * Command
    * Iterator
    * Mediator 
    * Memento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template Method
    * Visitor
# Why should I learn patterns?
The truth is that you might manage to work as a programmer for many years without knowing about a single pattern. A lot of people do just that. Even in that case, though, you might be implementing some patterns without even knowing it. So why would you spend time learning them?
 * Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
 * Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name.
